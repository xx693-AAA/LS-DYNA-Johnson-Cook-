# LS-DYNA-Johnson-Cook-
A wide range of strain rate sensitivity and impact-induced behavior
The results of the mechanical properties of the materials under wide strain rate were obtained by quasi-static compression tests and split Hopkinson press bar (SHPB) tests, and the material mechanical properties were described by the segmental parameter fitting of the Johnson Cook (JC) model. Based on LS-DYNA, numerical simulations under wide strain rate loading conditions are carried out to analyze the dynamic impact behavior of Al/PTFE reactive materials over a wide range of strain rates.
